# Pi Display

The purpose of this project is to display various data points on an e-ink display powered by a Raspberry Pi.

This project contains two parts:

1. `/python` contains all the files needed to retrieve and print all the data for the display.
1. `/webapp` contains a web app and node.js server that can be used to remotely refresh data and push custom messages to the display.
